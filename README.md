## AI-Movement
Written in Unity Script.

An AI pinguin that is able to search, detect and follow the player.

Besides using the WASD keys to move around its high-definition avatar (cough), the player can also dynamically increase or decrease the AI-pinguin's aggro range for testing purposes.

The pinguin model is made in Blender by fellow student [Katja Pennanen](https://github.com/katjapennanen).
